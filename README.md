# Movies-ETL
This project was designed as an introduction to ETL aka Extract, Transform, and Load. We used movie data from Kaggle and Wikipedia along with aggregated ratings were used to create a functional dataset for a hackathon.

We extracted the raw data from the two sources, transformed the data by cleaning up the rows, formatting datatypes, and then loaded the data into SQL.

## Software
- pgAdmin 4 Desktop Version 6.4
- Visual Studio Code Version 1.65.2
- Jupyter 6.4.5

## Overview
This analysis was conducted to created to automate the ETL process of the raw movie data. There were four primary steps to this analysis. We extracted the data, tested the data for functionality, transformed and cleaned the data, and then loaded the data to the appropriate database.
